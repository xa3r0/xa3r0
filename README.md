# 👋 Hey there, I'm JD!

Welcome to my digital den — where marketing strategy meets code, automation meets obsession, and curiosity refuses to sleep.

By day, I work as a **Digital Marketing Associate at Google**, deeply involved in optimizing campaigns and building smarter workflows. But my real joy comes from **automating the boring stuff**, solving problems creatively, and crafting tools that quietly get things done — so humans don’t have to.

## 🧠 What I’m All About

- 💡 **Marketing Technologist**  
  I bridge the gap between marketing ops and engineering logic — fluent in both campaign strategy and custom automation.

- 🤖 **Automation Addict**  
  If there’s a task that repeats, I script it. If there’s a workflow with friction, I fix it. *Efficiency isn’t optional; it’s oxygen.*

- 💻 **Code Curious**  
  Always building, tinkering, debugging, and learning. Comfortable with Google Apps Script, Python, HTML/CSS/JS, and making ideas come alive.

- 🛠️ **System Thinker**  
  Whether it’s optimizing a campaign or a daily habit tracker, I believe great systems create great outcomes. One tweak at a time.

- 🧘‍♂️ **Stoic in Progress**  
  I’m also on a mission to build better habits, fight digital distractions, and make time for what truly matters.
